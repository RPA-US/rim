    Finally we obtain an entiched log, which is turned as proof of concept of our hypothesis based on the premise that if
    we not only capture keyboard or mouse events on the monitorization through a keylogger, but also screencaptures,
    we can extract much more useful information, being able to improve the process mining over said log.
    As a pending task, we need to validate this hypothesis through a results comparison against the non-enriched log.
    We expect to continue this project in later stages of the master
